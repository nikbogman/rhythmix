# Rhythmix

Rhythmix is a work-in-progress simple web app that analyzes music tracks from SoundCloud. Given a track URL, it fetches the audio, processes it, and returns musical features like BPM, key, scale, and Camelot notation.

The goal is to make it easy for DJs to quickly analyze tracks right from the web.
